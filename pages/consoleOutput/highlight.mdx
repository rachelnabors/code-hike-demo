## Set up fullstack project with React and Amplify

In this walkthrough, you will:

* Create a new React app
* Install and use the Amplify CLI

Then you'll be ready to start adding backend capabilities to your app.

### Create a new React App

Navigate to your projects directory and run the following commands:

```
npx create-react-app react-amplified
cd react-amplified
```

This creates a new React app in a directory called **react-amplified** and then switches into the new directory.

From the **react-amplified* directory, run the app by using the following command:

```
npm start
```

This runs a development server and allows you to see the output generated by the build. You can see the running app by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Initialize a new backend

With the app running, it's time to set up Amplify and create the backend services to support the app.

1. Open a new terminal. 
2. Navigate to the **react-amplified** directory.
3. Run the following:

```
amplify init
```

When you initialize Amplify you'll be prompted for some information about the app, with the option to accept recommended values. The following walks you through the dialog:

Amplify CLI starts by asking you for a name for your project. 

**Enter ["reactamplified"](focus://1[32:46]).**

```
// mark(1:2) 
? Enter a name for the project reactamplified
The following configuration will be applied:

? Project information
| Name:  reactamplified
| Environment: dev
| Default editor: Visual Studio Code
| App type: javascript
| Javascript framework: react
| Source Directory Path: src
| Distribution Directory Path: build
| Build Command: npm run-script build
| Start Command: npm run-script start

? Initialize the project with the above configuration? Yes
Using default provider  awscloudformation
? Select the authentication method you want to use: AWS profile
? Please choose the profile you want to use default
```

---

Next, Amplify CLI will present you with a default project configuration and ask if you want to use it.

**Enter ["y"](focus://15[56:59]) to proceed with the defaults.**

```js mark=4:15
? Enter a name for the project reactamplified
The following configuration will be applied:

? Project information
| Name:  reactamplified
| Environment: dev
| Default editor: Visual Studio Code
| App type: javascript
| Javascript framework: react
| Source Directory Path: src
| Distribution Directory Path: build
| Build Command: npm run-script build
| Start Command: npm run-script start

? Initialize the project with the above configuration? Yes
Using default provider  awscloudformation
? Select the authentication method you want to use: AWS profile
? Please choose the profile you want to use default
```

---

You can choose to authenticate through your AWS Profile or using AWS access keys. 

**Use the arrow keys to choose "AWS Profile".**

```js mark=17
? Enter a name for the project reactamplified
The following configuration will be applied:

? Project information
| Name:  reactamplified
| Environment: dev
| Default editor: Visual Studio Code
| App type: javascript
| Javascript framework: react
| Source Directory Path: src
| Distribution Directory Path: build
| Build Command: npm run-script build
| Start Command: npm run-script start

? Initialize the project with the above configuration? Yes
Using default provider  awscloudformation
? Select the authentication method you want to use: AWS profile
? Please choose the profile you want to use default
```

---

**Use the arrow keys to select the AWS profile you want to use.**

This tutorial uses "default", but you can use any profile you like.

```js mark=18
? Enter a name for the project reactamplified
The following configuration will be applied:

? Project information
| Name:  reactamplified
| Environment: dev
| Default editor: Visual Studio Code
| App type: javascript
| Javascript framework: react
| Source Directory Path: src
| Distribution Directory Path: build
| Build Command: npm run-script build
| Start Command: npm run-script start

? Initialize the project with the above configuration? Yes
Using default provider  awscloudformation
? Select the authentication method you want to use: AWS profile
? Please choose the profile you want to use default
```

Amplify CLI is now spinning up your backend! A few things happening:

- It creates a top level directory called amplify that stores your backend definition. During the tutorial you'll add capabilities such as a GraphQL API and authentication. As you add features, the amplify folder will grow with infrastructure-as-code templates that define your backend stack. Infrastructure-as-code is a best practice way to create a replicable backend stack.
- It creates a file called aws-exports.js in the src directory that holds all the configuration for the services you create with Amplify. This is how the Amplify client is able to get the necessary information about your backend services.
- It modifies the .gitignore file, adding some generated files to the ignore list
- A cloud project is created for you in the AWS Amplify Console that can be accessed by running amplify console. The Console provides a list of backend environments, deep links to provisioned resources per Amplify category, status of recent deployments, and instructions on how to promote, clone, pull, and delete backend resources
